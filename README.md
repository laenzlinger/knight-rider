============

Idea: Getting started with arduino on minimum budget.

Material: 

 - Arduiono board: We have used the [Leonardo](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardLeonardo) because it was cheap, available and compatible to most of the UNO shields (for later projects). The UNO board was not so easily available anymore, therefore we decided for the Leonardy, although the hackability of the leanardo board is not so good compared to the UNO board (for example due to the SMD components).
 - Breadboard: Solderless protoyping board is very usefull for starting simple hardware projects. It is definitly worth the money.
 - Jumper wires: We used the wires a of CAT5 cable (20cm, 10cm and 5cm) because we were a bit impatient to build [better wires](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wpchXZIzJs) on our own.  
 - LEDs: We found a 5 pack of red leds including series resistor at our local DYI store.
 - Potentiometer: Disassembled from an old defect Walkman of the last century. 
 - Switches: Also disassembled from the Walkman. We soldered short cables to use them on our breadboard.
